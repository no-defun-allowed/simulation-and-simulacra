# SIMULATION AND SIMULACRA

A program that simulates "playing Minecraft", watching how many blaze rods drop
and how many ender pearls are traded for.

On a Radeon RX 580 card, this code takes about 1.28 seconds to perform 
(the default value of) 8192 simulation jobs, each performing 10,000 simulations.
This results in performing about 64 million simulations a second. Pretty neat
for my first OpenCL program.
